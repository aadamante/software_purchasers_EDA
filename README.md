# Analysis of Software Purchasers through a Mailing Experiment

# Overview:

This is a data analysis based on a dataset of a software catalog firm that sells games and educational software. This study uses descriptive statistics to find possible patterns and relationships among the variables to garner business insights. 

The business benefits from this analysis by understanding the purchaser behavior on the frequency of purchase, spending by type of order, spending by gender, among other analyses. Furthermore, models can be developed to classify customers as purchasers or non-purchasers, and predict the spending amount among purchasers. Â 

# Data Description:

The data used is a stratified sample that contains records of purchasers and non-purchasers. It is a dataset derived from a mailing experiment where a software offer was sent to a list of customers and the response of each customer was collected (did purchase or not, among other specifications). 

The data consist of 25 variables (some include dummies) and 2,000 customers and contain information on the type of catalog (catalog source), frequency of purchase in the last year, type of order (online or offline), spending, gender of the customer, and other variables.
